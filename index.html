        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologistðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Mehak Shahzad, a first year university student attending the University of California Riverside. I currently have enough credits to qualify as a finishing Sophomore with 84 credits. I went to Western Center Academy as my highschool and graduated with a 4.4 GPA. Iâ€™ve received student of the triad three times from my teachers in the grade level who unanimously selected me. I have been the leader in many of the group projects when no one else will step up, and make sure to take everyones opinion into account before assignment roles and making judgement calls. My peers would frequently come to me to ask for explanations and questions. I would be an informal tutor. I enjoy baking in my free time, and researching the science behind baking in my free time. My other hobbies include: reading fantasy novels and doing creative projects such as making a life size version of a board game, making diy swords and shields, and coding a mini text based adventure game. I frequently entertain my little cousins with projects, and try to ignite and maintain a flame for knowledge and curiosity with them. Due to this, I do have experience working with kids.<br><br>

        I have helped my uncle numerous times with odd jobs around the carwash. I have been a data collector by web scraping and collected a massive list of every single car wash in california. As well as, a data entry clerk entering customer information into spreadsheets and forms. I have been a helper with organizing files.This has enabled me to gain basic technology skills in data scraping, coding, researching, proficiency with Microsoft Excel, and much more. I have been part of the Ted-Ed club at my school and have created and presented two different speeches to the public. Due to this, I have also been fortunate enough to visit New York City for a Ted-Ed conference that was paid for by my school. Currently I have a job as a tutor helping children who need the extra support to do well in school. This allows me to gain experience working with kids, and teaching skills.
        <br><br>

        My ultimate goal is to become a psychologist who is able to perform research and contribute to the scientific community. As well as be a therapist to help the Muslim community, who suffers from a lack of mental health do to negative stigma, although I will be available for everyone regardless of race, relegion, ethnicity, and gender. Along the way I hope to open up a cozy little cafe where I can occasionally help bake pastries and treats. I want it to be a place of comfort and peace for people. To achieve this I have been learning how to make the desserts of various different regions from Pakistan to Greece. For the mean time I am going to keep striving for my goal of being a Psychologist and hope to get my masters degree in therapy, and later on attend graduate school to get my phd. I am currently exploring the vast and broad fields of psychology to figure out what is my niche, and what are my favorite parts of psychology to study and research.
